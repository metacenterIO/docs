> Welcome to Metacenter Docs

Metacenter is a cost based analytics and chargeback tool for Kubernetes. Our goal is to enable Metacenter customers to run Kubernetes efficiently without sacrificing performance or availability.

?> At this time Metacenter works with clusters in AWS. We intend to add more cloud providers moving forward.
